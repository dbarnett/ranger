Ranger v.1.3.0
==============

Ranger is a free console file manager that gives you greater flexibility
and a good overview of your files without having to leave your *nix console.
It visualizes the directory tree in two dimensions: the directory hierarchy
on one, lists of files on the other, with a preview to the right so you know
where you'll be going.

The default keys are similar to those of Vim, Emacs and Midnight Commander,
though Ranger is easily controllable with just the arrow keys or the mouse.

The program is written in Python (2.6 or 3.1) and uses curses for the
text-based user interface.

Getting Started
---------------

Ranger can be started without installing.  Just run the executable (in
a terminal.)  The switch "--clean" will prevent it from creating or
accessing configuration files.

Follow the instructions in the INSTALL file for installing ranger.

After starting ranger, you should see 4 columns. The third one is the main
column, the directory where you're currently at.  To the left you see the
parent directories and to the right there's a preview of the object you're
pointing at.  Now use the Arrow Keys to navigate, Enter to open a file
or type Q to quit.

To customize ranger, copy the files from ranger/defaults/ to ~/.config/ranger/
and modify them according to your wishes.


Usage Tips
----------

The author of ranger uses this function (in ~/.bashrc) to start ranger:
function ranger-cd {
  before="$(pwd)"
  python2.6 /the/path/to/ranger/ranger.py --fail-unless-cd "$@" || return 0
  after="$(grep \^\' ~/.config/ranger/bookmarks | cut -b3-)"
  if [[ "$before" != "$after" ]]; then
    cd "$after"
  fi
}
bind '"\C-o":"ranger-cd\C-m"'

This changes the directory after you close ranger and adds the shortcut
<CTRL-O> for starting ranger.

To change back to the previous directory, you can type: cd -


Troubleshooting, Getting Help
-----------------------------

If you encounter an error, try running ranger with --debug.  This will
sometimes display more detailed information about the error.  Also, try
deactivating optimization:

PYTHONOPTIMIZE="" ranger --debug

Further Reading
---------------

Check the man page for information on common features and hotkeys.

The most detailed manual is accessible by pressing "?" from inside ranger.
It is also available at ranger/help/, contained in the *.py files.

The file ranger/defaults/keys.py contains all key combinations, so that's
another place you may want to check out.
