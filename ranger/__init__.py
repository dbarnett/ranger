Console-based visual file manager.

Ranger is a file manager with an ncurses frontend written in Python.
It is designed to give you a broader overview of the file system by
displaying previews and backviews, dividing the screen into columns.

The keybindings are similar to those of other console programs like
vim, mutt or ncmpcpp so the usage will be intuitive and efficient.
