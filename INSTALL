Installing
==========

Use the package manager of your operating system to install ranger.

To install ranger manually, use either:
sudo ./setup.py install --optimize=1 --record=install_log.txt

or for short:
sudo make install


Uninstalling
============

Again, use your package manager to uninstall ranger.  No other way for
automatically removing ranger is supported!

However, if you installed ranger with the command above, all installed files
have been recorded to "install_log.txt".  This information can be used to remove
ranger by hand, e.g.:

cat install_log.txt | sed s/\^/\\// | xargs -d "\n" sudo rm --
